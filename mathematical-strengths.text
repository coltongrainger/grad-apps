	induction
	proof by contradiction

	\entry{MAT-370}{Geometry}{A}{3}{Jonny Comes}{\bibentry{hitchman2009}}{A preparation for Felix Klein's \emph{Erlangen} program. Developed geometry in terms of a space and a group of transformations of that space. Emphasis on congruence relations. Unpacked the theory of complex functions in relation to hyperbolic geometry.}

	Partial differential equations

	\entry{MAT-498}{Upper Division Seminar}{A}{1}{Dave Rosoff}{\bibentry{farlow1993}}{A student-led seminar addressing partial differential equations in mathematical modeling. A prep for the COMAP contest. I presented the Fourier series solution to the heat equation.}
