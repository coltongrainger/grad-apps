Meta-understanding of maths. Metaphorically a journey through an unfamilar domain. From [Eliezer Yudkowsky](http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/) 
> believing, and updating on evidence, so as to systematically improve the correspondence between your map and the territory
As an occasional rock climber, I really enjoy the play between "math improves one's map of territory" and "programming is climbing a mountain". Rosoff once commented that a meta-theorem of math was to prove useful theorems alone, and once for all, so that higher level math can be done. 

Which amounts to having explored (either in detail or with breadth) common features and routes in the foundational territory of mathematical knowledge. 

I think of theorems and installations, then, as signposts in a domain. When performing mathematical research, or a long computation, theorems are like carabiners.

From [Philip Guo](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/code-carabiners-essential-protection-tools-for-safe-programming)
> Somewhere around a few hundred lines of code, your code base becomes too large to fit inside your head; you start to forget why you wrote certain code in a quirky way; and you don’t quite remember what you were trying to do last week, or what assumptions about your internal data structures still hold true. Is that snippet of documentation from last month still valid? What about this TODO note? And how come this function used to work so well but doesn’t anymore? What made it suddenly break? Wait, how did this other module ever work? ARGH!!!

From [How People Learn](https://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/LearningBiology/readings/How-people-learn.pdf) 
> The new science of learning does not deny that facts are important for thinking and problem solving. Research on expertise in areas such as chess, history, science, and mathematics demonstrate that experts’ abilities to think and solve problems depend strongly on a *rich body of knowledge about subject matter* (e.g., Chase and Simon, 1973; Chi et al., 1981; deGroot, 1965).  However, the research also shows clearly that “usable knowledge” is not the same as a mere list of disconnected facts. Experts’ knowledge is connected and organized around important concepts (e.g., Newton’s second law of motion); it is “conditionalized” to specify the contexts in which it is applicable; it supports understanding and transfer (to other contexts) rather than only the ability to remember.
