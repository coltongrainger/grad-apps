I aim to pursue a PhD in Mathematics, and my career aspiration is to become an applied mathematician. My research interests include topological data analysis (TDA), algebraic topology, and scientific computing. 

The abstraction that a mathematical discipline provides determines the domain on which it can be fruitfully applied. Just imagine discovering an affinity network between websites using only harmonic analysis, or modeling an epidemic with strictly deterministic differential equations. I aim to study algebraic topology, and concomitant computational methods, to explore the versatility of spatial intuition in data analysis.

Consider training a computer to distinguish the tone signature of various musical instruments: the persistence of certain features (components, holes, cavities) in the data can be seen as a sample statistic for probabilistic analysis. 


I approach advanced study of mathematics related to TDA by looking at examples first 

in which frequency analysis I approach advanced study

representative sets of data can be used to create simplicial complexes can be computationally implemented jkk

From my study of Galois theory with Dr. Jonny Comes, my introduction to topology equations with Dr. Jonny Comes, and Prof. Dave Rosoff, and continuing 

I am ambitious to participate in dialogue persistent homology as a tool for understanding the shape of data.

Meta-understanding of maths. Metaphorically a journey through an unfamilar domain. From [Eliezer Yudkowsky](http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/)
> believing, and updating on evidence, so as to systematically improve the correspondence between your map and the territory
As an occasional rock climber, I really enjoy the play between "math improves one's map of territory" and "programming is climbing a mountain". Rosoff once commented that a meta-theorem of math was to prove useful theorems alone, and once for all, so that higher level math can be done. Which amounts to having explored (either in detail or with breadth) common features and routes in the foundational territory of mathematical knowledge. I think of theorems and installations, then, as signposts in a domain. When performing mathematical research, or a long computation, theorems are like carabiners.

From [Philip Guo](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/code-carabiners-essential-protection-tools-for-safe-programming)
> Somewhere around a few hundred lines of code, your code base becomes too large to fit inside your head; you start to forget why you wrote certain code in a quirky way; and you don’t quite remember what you were trying to do last week, or what assumptions about your internal data structures still hold true. Is that snippet of documentation from last month still valid? What about this TODO note? And how come this function used to work so well but doesn’t anymore? What made it suddenly break? Wait, how did this other module ever work? ARGH!!!

From [How People Learn](https://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/LearningBiology/readings/How-people-learn.pdf) 
> The new science of learning does not deny that facts are important for thinking and problem solving. Research on expertise in areas such as chess, history, science, and mathematics demonstrate that experts’ abilities to think and solve problems depend strongly on a *rich body of knowledge about subject matter* (e.g., Chase and Simon, 1973; Chi et al., 1981; deGroot, 1965).  However, the research also shows clearly that “usable knowledge” is not the same as a mere list of disconnected facts. Experts’ knowledge is connected and organized around important concepts (e.g., Newton’s second law of motion); it is “conditionalized” to specify the contexts in which it is applicable; it supports understanding and transfer (to other contexts) rather than only the ability to remember.

- I divided up my time between personal and professional projects. Here I highlight some of my professional projects. In general, I focused on developing novel, scalable resources for persistent issues in refugee case management. I began to build an [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coltongrainger/ymca-resources) of forms and instructions for low income healthcare applications and rental assistance. I established contact with and solicited feedback from staff in the Harris Health System, at the Islamic Society of Greater Houston, and at Gulf Coast Community Services Association. I incorporated my experience in direct service with the higher-level feedback from each organization. I found the best way for case managers to submit applications and detailed exactly what is expected of the client during the application process. Because our clients have limited English proficiency, I emphasized that case managers need to be aggressive and “get the job done” when faced with unnecessarily complicated release of information constraints. I also learned more about Shaoli’s Refugee Health Working Group. I created and distributed a [map of clinics](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kk9yn6-4nifHLIf2tGYbW_7PiYo&usp=sharing). I participated in a refugee health needs assessment with medical students at Baylor. I even was fortunate to be invited to contribute to the design of a data management plan for the next refugee social service database. The above examples are united by a common thread: each represents a small contribution to a larger dialogue surrounding the resettlement of displaced persons.
