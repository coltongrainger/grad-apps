\opening{Coordinator Hicks,}

I am enthusiastic to learn more about working as a \jobtitle\ in the \company. 

I am curious if the skills I have developed in refugee medical care are transferrable to what is required as an AmeriCorps VISTA. I have served 1 year in the Texas Episcopal Service Corps, and most of my year has been in direct service to clients. 

\begin{itemize}
\item How does an AmeriCorps VISTA's responsibility to ``build capacity" differ from direct service? 
\item What populations does the \company\ support?
\end{itemize}
% I have performed clerical work since 2015, when I was hired as a grading assistant. %By taking a share of her administrative responsibilities, I gave my supervisor more time to focus on research and curriculum design. 
% In 2016 I graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics-Physics. Shortly after, I committed to a year of service in the Episcopal Service Corps. I am fulfilling this commitment by working as a clerk at the YMCA International Services, a refugee resettlement agency in Houston, TX. My completion date in the Service Corps is July 15, 2017. %I plan to begin in a professional position in Olympia, WA by July \nth{24}.

I work now on a small team to support refugees with complex medical conditions. 
%I balance my clerical duties with client service. 
Each month, I interact with 40 clients and write 100 case notes. For clients, I arrange medical appointments, transportation and interpretation. I am also responsible for for low-income healthcare applications. In emergency situations, I accompany clients to safety net services. %As a clerk, I maintain 200 client case files, including their medical records, financial eligibility information, and immigration documents.
\begin{itemize}
\item What are the \jobtitle's responsibilities in comparison?
\end{itemize}
I forward this information to you with hope to begin a correspondence.

% In contributing to  workflow at \company, I anticipate that I will
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item receive clients, schedule appointments and handle referrals;
% 	\item prepare agendas, meeting minutes, and reminders for office deadlines;
% 	\item draft, revise, and copy-edit documents as needed;
% 	\item maintain physical/electronic records and sort sensitive mail;
% 	\item write macros to manage data and utilize computational solutions; and
% 	\item relieve staff of miscellaneous administrative burdens.
% \end{itemize}
% As these responsibilities mirror those I have already taken on, I am confident that I can increase \company's administrative capacity from my start date.

% Outside of my professional interests, I am passionate about cycling, hiking, and computer science. I have ambition to pursue higher education in mathematics and, eventually, work towards environmental preservation. 

\closing{Thank you!}
%\emph{P.S.\ I am available via email, by phone after 3:00 P.M.\ PST, or by scheduled video-chat.}
