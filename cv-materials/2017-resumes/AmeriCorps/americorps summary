After I graduated with a BS in 2016, I committed to a year in the Texas Episcopal Service Corps. 

My service site is a refugee resettlement agency in Houston, TX.

I work on small team to support refugees with complex medical conditions. 

I would like to apply what I've learned to a second year of impactful service. 

Both my supervisor at resettlement agency and my service corps director served two years in AmeriCorps. They described a common experience: "learning for the first year and making a difference in the second."

I intent to complete a second year of service as "Practicum", that is, lived experience that supports my vocational calling. 

I have ambition to pursue higher education in mathematics and, eventually, work towards environmental preservation.
