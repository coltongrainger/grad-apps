\opening{Committee Member,}
I aim to enroll at Oregon State University to become quantitatively literate. I am attracted to V.~Bokil's and N.~Gibson's research in fluid flows, electromagnetics and multiscale processes. Under their instruction, I would design and implement numerical methods to model rivers and aquifers in the Pacific Northwest. Upon completion of a master's degree, I plan to complete a Ph.D. and enter an ecological industry.

Here are two motivated descriptions of my research interests. 
\begin{description}[topsep=0pt]
	\item[Sediment Transport]
		In Idaho's Treasure Valley, farmers use a network of reservoirs and canals to suspend and divert the Boise river. To understand how this irrigation regime sweeps up and transports material, I would model water's energy in flood irrigated fields. Constrained by agricultural machinery and topography, I would search for furrow patterns that minimize water's turbidity. As a separate, more dynamical project, I would consider canal geometries that interrupt high-velocity flows.
	\item[Ground Water Contamination]
		With the Army's decision to not grant an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline, I have a redoubled motivation to study contaminant diffusion. Were I contributing to an environmental impact statement, I would (i) consider geomorphic stresses on the pipeline and (ii) model hydrocarbon dispersion at points of stress. I imagine the first topic, characterizing a stress tensor, to be accessible as an inverse problem from geological data. I would approach the second, modeling dispersion from an uncertain source, with a modified finite element method.
\end{description}

I share two examples of my relevant research experience. 
\begin{description}[topsep=0pt]
    \item[Galois Theory \& Fuchsian Equations] 
    	Following Michio Kuga's analysis of Fuchsian-type differential equations, I parameterized the solution space of the hypergeometric equation. For 5 interesting cases, I found the monodromy representation at singular points. I presented my method, its history and a potential application to \topic{fluid flow} at The College of Idaho's 2016 student research conference.
    \item[Igneous Dikes in Scotland]
        Relying on N.~L.~Bowen's \emph{The Evolution of the Igneous Rocks}, I modeled the cooling of plagioclase feldspar magma. I proposed that my geology abroad group in Scotland visit Glen Sligachan, a significant site for Bowen's field observations. On June \nth{4}, noticing rough shards of buoyantly exposed olivine lodged within dense clusters of plagioclase crystals, we validated Bowen's hypothesis that molten plagioclase carried partially solidified mafic minerals into the crust. 
\end{description}

Please consider me as a candidate for a teaching assistantship. I summarize what has prepared me to teach. 
\begin{description}[topsep=0pt]
	\item[Tutoring \& Grading] I \term{tutored calculus students} one-on-one and \term{graded physics coursework}. I guided small groups through problems in elementary electromagnetism. I heard out my peers in introductory topology and posed constructive questions. As a Heritage Scholar at The College of Idaho, I led discussions in colloquium. In seminar, I organized half-hour workshops on the logistic equation and the heat equation. I also delivered an hour presentation on \term{epidemiological modeling}. 
	\item[Time Away from School] In the last year, I volunteered on a ranch in Germany and worked at a refugee resettlement office in Texas. Here are two examples of how these experiences refined my teaching ability. First, while I learned \LaTeX\ to typeset proofs in analysis and topology, I have also used it to create bus guides in Spanish and Arabic. Second, while I was exposed to G.~Polya's guided problem solving and R.~L.~Moore's inquiry based method in college, I have applied their pedagogy to my work across language barriers: I plan ahead, relax and co-create the space for mutual questions.
\end{description}

Presently, I am a fellow in the Texas Episcopal Service Corps. I live in Houston with two other fellows and work as a medical care intern. This work demonstrates a unique breadth in my qualifications: I advocate for clients with limited English proficiency in the nation's densest health-care bureaucracy; I accompany them as they navigate metropolitan transit; I maintain copies of their medical records to ensure continuity of care.

I am confident that I would contribute formidably to your program. Thank you for your consideration.

\closing{Respectfully,\\Colton Grainger}
