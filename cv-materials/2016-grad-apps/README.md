# M.A. and M.S. Applications
I'm [@ColtonGrainger](https://twitter.com/ColtonGrainger). Here are copies of my applications to Applied Mathematics programs.

## Research Interests
Numerical methods for PDEs. Inverse problems. Applications to ground water percolation and contaminant diffusion.

## Teaching Qualifications
I've tutored calculus and graded physics, I've led a modeling seminar thrice, and I've worked the last year in refugee medical case management. I'm a strong candidate for a teaching assistantship on academic and professional grounds.
