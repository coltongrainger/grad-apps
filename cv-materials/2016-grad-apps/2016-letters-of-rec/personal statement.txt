\opening{To whom it may concern,}

Here's background to my interest in an applied mathematics program. I was finishing my senior research project in Fuchsian differential equations. As I had five weeks before my poster needed to be finished, I searched the library for potential applications. I discovered an author P. Ya.\ Polubarinova Kochina. She had written a book called \emph{The Theory of Groundwater Movement}. Apparently a classic application of Fuchsian differential equations arose in connection with fluid flow through a porous rectangular dam. This sparked my attention.\footnote{I like water. I like how it flows. I like aquifers and riverbeds and irrigation canals.}

However, I ended up following a different trail in my research. In trying to access the translation of Kochina's book, I stumbled into Jeremey Gray's \emph{Linear Differential Equations and Group Theory from Riemann to Poincare}. This test was rather well written (and easier to access online). Gray presented a view of mathematics which I had never seen: slow, heuristic and collaborative.

So it came to pass. I forgot about Kochina’s classical rectangular dam. My research project had excellent historical background and poorly developed physical application. However, the theory of automorphic functions I had picked up from Gray's book encouraged me to relate analysis and fluids.

The whole project really whet my palate. Naturally, I'd like to know more about both the development and the application of Fuchsian differential equations. Now, beyond interest, I feel I have a responsibility to become quantitatively literate. 

% Consequently, I want to matriculate into the department of applied mathematics at CU Boulder. 

I want some methods to approach questions such as
	\begin{itemize}
    \item In what style of irrigation does the least water evaporate?
	\item How quickly do contaminants diffuse across an ecosystem? 
	\item What is the most durable composition that can be made from locally available materials?
	\end{itemize}

With a master’s degree in applied mathematics, I imagine myself promoting efficient use of resources. I also imagine myself creating safe places for people to live. This is why, at graduate school, I want to learn \emph{techniques}. 

I also hope to learn theory behind methods. I hope to be authentic with my peers about what I know and don't know. I think sort of honesty promotes healthy collaboration. By the end of my first year, I imagine myself joining a reading/research group in an area of geophysical applied mathematics. 

As I have valuable insights to offer, I am interested in joining a growing program. I have lived in rural and urban areas, spent time with individuals of many ages and cultural backgrounds, and worked up an ambitious scholastic appetite in the process.

I am a good researcher, an excellent collaborator and a creative teacher. I persist through drafts and revisions. I solicit feedback. I write up solutions in plain language. I enjoy building models, plotting six or seven different curves in a family, and perturbing parameters. 

% This year I am working as a clerk at a social services office for refugees in Houston. I persist in obtaining information from Medicaid programs, I organize that information, and I interpret that information for clients. If I can create a database with many different ``filters’’ in plain language written in code easily read on a computer screen with low literacy users in mind, will clients be more comfortable taking the bus to their appointments?

% Here are the strongest parts of my background: communication, teaching, motivation, creativity. I enjoy collecting my findings and presenting them to others. I also enjoy resolving to research for the day at the library. 

\closing{Under your consideration,}
