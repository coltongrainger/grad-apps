Professor Dull, 

You have instructed me in analytical physics, thermal physics and electro-magnetism.

In your courses, I learned to
	-read and write for physics daily
	-explore additional resources
	-orally communicate complex arguments

May you discuss my rigor and hard work? May you mention my familiarity with SI units? My course work in electricity and magnetism and thermal physics? 

These subjects are important to my application in that they demonstrate my familiarity with vector calculus, probability and statistics, and partial differential equations. 

I would appreciate if you spoke of my capacity to process daily read and note taking. I think this skill allows me to quickly ``ramp up’’ to the assigned curriculum.

As well, may you mention in our small group recitations I was an aide to my peers and had a decent amount of peer-to-peer pedagogic experiences?

I feel that I prepared for your classes, collaborated with my peers, and used Mathematic and \LaTeX\ to polish my homework and presentations.



% Applied Mathematics = a more consistent life. It brings together life enriching time in wilderness, time communicating with my peers, and time in my vocation. To start local and dig in deep. What do I intend to do with a Ph. D.? Solve problems. Its my responsibility as a member of the species. Let’s have a smaller human footprint.

% I begin an independent study of linear algebra. and  independent study of Bruce Shapiro’s scientific computing: python for math junkies

% My recommendations can attest to my aptitude in logical rigour. As well as completing those two (fundamental) year-long sequences, I imagine myself taking the 400/500 level course in complex analysis and applications. 

% This year I am doing ``clerical’’ work and assisting with refugee case management in Houston.
