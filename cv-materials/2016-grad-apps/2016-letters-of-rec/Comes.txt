What do I imagine myself doing with a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics? Competitively applying for a Ph.\ D. in Applied Mathematics. Yet, at the same time, a Master’s degree is a professional degree.

I hope to embark on a curriculum of (i) computational mathematics (including linear algebra, python coding, and numerical analysis) and (ii) pure mathematics (complex analysis, prob and stats). With this curriculum completed, I would like to continue to research / model a complex problem in my immediate society or my local ecosystem.

I want to study stochastic processes, nonlinear phenomenon, and partial differential equations.

Applied Mathematics = a more consistent life. It brings together life enriching time in wilderness, time communicating with my peers, and time in my vocation. To start local and dig in deep. What do I intend to do with a Ph. D.? Solve problems. Its my responsibility as a member of the species. Let’s have a smaller human footprint.

I begin an independent study of linear algebra. and  independent study of Bruce Shapiro’s scientific computing: python for math junkies

My recommendations can attest to my aptitude in logical rigour. As well as completing those two (fundamental) year-long sequences, I imagine myself taking the 400/500 level course in complex analysis and applications.
