Professor Maughan,

You have instructed me in 18th and 19th century European history. As well, you served as my scholarship advisor last year.

In your courses, I learned to 
	-search, find and parse historical literature
	-concretize examples
	-participate in conference style discussions
	-write analytically

As you write my recommendation letter, may you mention my critical thinking skills? My ability to comment intelligently in the classroom? 

%Maybe you mention some of my more ``philological’’ training? This prepares me for the tedium / stadium of graduate school. 

%In your classes, I initiated research above and beyond what was expected. As well, I enjoyed listening and carefully thinking about my peers’ perspectives. 

As I flourish under creative restraint, I look forward to embarking on a steep graduate curriculum. May you help me explain this to the application review committee? I believe I will do well in a collaborative, research-intensive environment.

I would also appreciate if you described the quality of my character and my potential for growth. I believe I am an excellent candidate for a ``formative graduate experience.’’

In my application, I emphasize I am both academically and professionally prepared for a Master’s program. I also try to hammer home the fact that I imagine myself finding a career in geophysical applied mathematics. I want to contribute to the species’ knowledge of complex ecological phenomenon, with the hopes of decreasing our footprint. I want to lead a paradigm shift towards smaller, efficient, and more aesthetic, modes of living.



This year I am doing ``clerical’’ work and assisting with refugee case management in Houston. In part, this year gives me time 
	-to develop some professional discipline
	-for reading and writing
	-to build competency in programming languages

I hope to be exceedingly prepared to tutor undergraduate students. 

I also hope to be fresh to meet the graduate school’s expectations.

Applied Mathematics = a more consistent life. It brings together life enriching time in wilderness, time communicating with my peers, and time in my vocation. To start local and dig in deep. What do I intend to do with a Ph. D.? Solve problems. Its my responsibility as a member of the species. Let’s have a smaller human footprint.
