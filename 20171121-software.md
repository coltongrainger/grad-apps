Two logs: software I use and software I want to try out. I've included "discovery" credits, for the person through which I learned of the software.

| in use | description | credit | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| vim | text editing | [Issa Rice][vim] |
| Hangouts | video chat, screencasts | [Philip Guo][hangouts] |
| 'git' | version control | [GitHub][git] |

| in trial | expectation | credit | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| mutt | to ``tame emails'' | [Matt Might][mutt] |
| emacs Org mode | to catalog tasks, TODO lists | [Issa Rice][emacs] |

## Meta
How to organize?
- chronology
	- by discovery
	- by installation
- popularity
	- most used
	- most accolades
- utility
	- normal operating range
	- design features
